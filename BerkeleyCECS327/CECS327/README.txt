In order to run you must first download all 3 files and save them in a desired folder in a Linux machine. The required libraries are simgrid and cmake so first if needed sudo aptget install cmake, and if needed for simgrid you should be free to pip install simgrid in your python now. If needed you can sudo aptget install pip for python if not already downloaded. Once you have simgrid and cmake you can then cd to your directory that holds the 3 files. cd /desiredfolderpath/. and once in the folder run python berkeley_simulation.py platform.xml deployment.xml.
