# DistributedSystemResearchProject (CECS327)

Abstract - This paper will analyze the effectiveness of two distributed system clock synchronization algorithms based on factors such as network-wide clock accuracy, hardware requirements, network topology, and clock utilization. The selected algorithms were Berkeley’s Algorithm and the Precision Time Protocol. SimGrid is a framework for simulating the development of distributed application executions on distributed platforms, which we used with Python for experimentation. Data will be provided to offer a pragmatic view of the different algorithms’ uses.
